# Quadratic-Equation-Auto-Generation-Exercise-with-Answers-for-Student-s-practice
This is a simple script written in HTML/CSS. It uses JavaScript to enable its dynamic behavior. Every time you refresh the page, you will get a new set of quadratic equations with answers.  It has a little bug in the script and I encourage anyone interested to help me fix it.  Have fun.
